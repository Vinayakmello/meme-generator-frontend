# Simple Meme Generator (Frontend-Only MVP)

This is a minimal meme generator built as a **single-page, frontend-only** web app.

You can:

- Upload an image from your computer
- Add top and bottom meme text
- See a live preview
- Download the final meme as a PNG

Everything happens in your browser – no backend, no account, no data is uploaded anywhere.

## How to run locally

1. Open this folder in your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
3. That’s it – the app should work immediately.

If you prefer, you can also serve the folder with any simple static server, but it is **not required**.

## Tech stack

- HTML – page structure (`index.html`)
- CSS – layout and styling (`styles.css`)
- JavaScript – image handling, canvas drawing, and download logic (`script.js`)

No external libraries or build tools are used.

## Basic usage

1. Click **“Upload image”** and choose a JPG, PNG, or GIF from your computer.
2. Type your **Top text** and **Bottom text** in the text fields.
3. Watch the **preview** update live.
4. When you’re happy, click **“Download meme”** to save it as `meme.png`.

If you don’t see a download, make sure you’re using a modern browser and that popups are not blocked for this page.
